# DeepEval Metrics Guide

## Project Overview

This project focuses on implementing various evaluation metrics from the DeepEval testing framework in Python. The goal is to provide a comprehensive and efficient way to evaluate LLM outputs using standardized metrics.

## Features

- Implementation of multiple evaluation metrics from the DeepEval framework
- Easy integration with existing LLM Models like OpenAI and Huggingface Transformer pipeline
- Detailed documentation and examples for each metric
- High performance and accuracy

## Installation


To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the evaluation metrics in your project, import the desired metric and apply it to your chatbot's output. Below is an example:

```python
from deepeval_metrics import MetricName

# Example usage
metric = MetricName()
result = metric.evaluate(chatbot_output, expected_output)
print(result)
```
